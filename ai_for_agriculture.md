# What are we doing now?

We are in ***Discovery*** phase of ***Design Thinking philosophy***.     

![img](https://github.com/AiForAgriculture/aiforagriculture.github.io/raw/master/assets/img/design_thinking_process.jpg)

- Design Thinking is a solution-focused discipline that aims to match a customer’s needs with well-designed, technologically feasible solutions.
- We are following ***The Double Diamond*** Strategy (the green dotted line diamonds in above image), which basically means "solve the problems by diverging and converging".



<a name="example_Discovery_Phase"></a>
### Brief example of Discovery Phase
- Sample vision of Discovery phase, applying Design Thinking Double Diamond Strategy.

![img](https://github.com/AiForAgriculture/aiforagriculture.github.io/raw/master/assets/img/Discovery_phase.jpg)



<a name="Discovery_phase"></a>
### Steps in the Discovery phase?

1. Competitive Analysis 
    - Planning and conducting consumer research at 'early stage' of the product’s lifecycle
    - Competitive Analysis using “Business Model” Canvas
    
1. Define Problem Statment 
    - What problem are we trying to solve?
    - How do we know this is a real problem?
    - Why is it important to solve?
    - Who are our users? What are their goals and motivations?
    - How will we know if we’ve solved the problem?
    - “How Might We” Questions
    - PROBLEM STATEMENT FORMAT
        ```
        [The name of your proto-persona]
        needs a way to [user’s need]
        because [insight].
        We will know this to be true when we see [this quantitative / qualitative measure].
        ```
    
1. Interview questioner
    - Prepare user interview questioner for our target group. 

1. Document user interview results
    - Document and submit user interview results and actionable product research findings.

1. Craft personas 
    - Craft personas and other “information radiators” (e.g. journey maps, Affinity mapping) 

1. POC Ideation
     - Craft “information radiators” (e.g. journey maps, Affinity mapping)

# Farm Visits.     
During our product research, we visited several farms in Germany and India.    
We have collected useful insights by not only conducting farmer interviews but also participating in field activities together with farmers!    


Below is the list of farms and data collected,   

<a name="Sonndorf"></a>   
1. ***Community Agriculture, Sonndorf,  Germany. June 2022***       
    - In this type of Community Agriculture, farmers have members or subscribers, who are making monthly payments to farmers in return to get a box of produce from the farm.  
    - Members do not necessarily have to contribute to the farming activity.  
    - After discussion with the farmer we realize that he is really short of helping hand and would love to have members who will also take part in agricultural activity.   
    - [![Sonndorf!](https://github.com/AiForAgriculture/aiforagriculture.github.io/raw/master/assets\img\Sonndorf.JPG)](https://youtu.be/WeJ8HEcUYMo)    


<a name="Hollerhof"></a>   
1. ***Organic family farm, Hollerhof, Hartmannsdorf-Reichenau Germany. June 2022***     
    - https://www.hollerhof-erzgebirge.de/   
    - In this video we visited the “Hollerhof”, a beautiful small family managed organic farm in countryside of Hartmannsdorf-Reichenau Germany.  
    - It was a refreshing and hands-on learning experience for me.  
    - Both Tobias and Eva are wonderful hosts and their property is even more beautiful!  
    - They have utilised their countryside property very neatly, allowing them to experiment with many different varieties of crops.   
    - They have a portion of the farm for mixed vegetable beds, potatoes, strawberries and a small greenhouse for tomatoes.   
    - I was able to help in removing weeds from the vegetable garden, by hand as well as using a few instruments.   
    - I really enjoyed helping them in the clipping and pruning activity for tomato plants in a small greenhouse.

# Case Studies.

<a name="Potato_farm"></a>
### 1. Image based crops readiness for Potato farm.

![img](https://github.com/AiForAgriculture/aiforagriculture.github.io/raw/master/assets/img/potato/potato1.jpg)

1. Asking the right questions
    - What
        - Potato crop readiness prediction
    - Why
        - manual resource heavy process 
        - regular manual monitoring
        - unpredictable weather and raining conditions
        - leads less productive and to heavy losses 
    - Who
        - farmer
        - farming firms
        - Agriculture Insurance companies
    - How
        - AI - Image processing
        - Smartphone based app
        - historic data
        - crop file cycle insights
        - proactive alerts 
        - ***more productive*** with ***fewer resources and monitoring***          

1. Persona
    - Proto persona: ***the farmer - Markus***
    - ![img](https://github.com/AiForAgriculture/aiforagriculture.github.io/raw/master/assets/img/persona.jpg)

1. Problem Statement
    - Markus needs a way to automate monitoring of crops readiness. Currently this is very manual process as he needs to visit farm every time.  
    - We need to enable Markus to monitor his potato corps from remote location using his smartphone like device. He even empowered with timely insights and alerts for crop readiness. 

1. Research Based Method (research dataset)
    - Question for research script
        1. Potato farming in Germany, facts.
        2. How potato farming done today; organic / conventional?
        3. How to identify if crop is ready?
        4. How much loses happen due to "false crop readiness"?
        5. Why dose loses happen?     
    - Matrix for research script

1. Discovery
    - [Horticulture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horticulture)
        - Horticulturists apply knowledge, skills, and technologies to grow intensively produced plants for human food and non-food uses and for personal or social needs.
    - [Vertical-farming](https://roboticsandautomationnews.com/2019/05/03/top-25-vertical-farming-companies/22181/)
        - vertical farming refers to the practice of producing fruits and vegetables vertically, in stacked layers, perhaps on many floors inside a building, using artificial lights instead of the sun, and a whole range of relatively new technologies.
        - The key technologies in vertical farming include:
            - perception technologies 
            - artificial intelligence 
            - automated and even autonomous mechatronics 
    - [What Is Precision Farming, And Who Are The Players To Watch?](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-is-precision-farming-and-who-are-the-players-to-watch-2020-10-07)
        - Precision agriculture is a management strategy that gathers, processes and analyzes temporal, spatial and individual data and combines it with other information to support management decisions according to estimated variability for improved resource use efficiency, productivity, quality, profitability and sustainability of agricultural production.
        - GPS tractor guidance helped farmers to improve crop production by reducing overlaps and gaps when planting, fertilizing, and protecting crops.
        - capabilities of precision agriculture as well,
            - Choosing suitable crops with higher yields and more lucrative markets
            - Measure the performance of the site by automatically capturing relevant data
            - Increasing the farm’s economic and environmental sustainability
            - Predicting climate changes and reacting to them proactively
        - Farmobile and its DataEngine that ingests and standardizes farming data so that it can be shared and used to create insights; 
        - Trace Genomics that provides soil DNA sequencing services to farmers and agronomists; and 
        - CiBo Technologies that allows farmers to create “virtual fields” with real-world inputs.
    - [Is disparate agronomic data dead?](https://start.agritask.com/blog/is-disparate-agronomic-data-dead/)
        - analyzing agricultural data,
            - 1. Pure agronomic data which includes the data related to the plants themselves
            - 2. Operational data. From spraying to harvesting, plowing to fertilizing, operational data includes information on materials, human resources, machinery, and more.
            - 3. Environmental data. This includes data regarding weather, soil, water, topography, and others that affect crop yield and quality, as well as management plans.
    - [Horticulture LEDs](https://images.samsung.com/is/content/samsung/p5/led/lighting/applications/horticulture-lighting/White_Paper_Samsung_Horticulture_LED_181121.pdf)
        - The spectral engineering wavelengths produced by LED lighting are playing an important role in enhancing plant growth and development.
        - That’s because plant physiology and morphology are strongly influenced by the wavelength optimization impacting a plant’s surface. 
        - An optimal strategy for using high-quality LED lighting in horticulture would be to select the best spectra for a specific crop or cultivar, one that offers improved quality in the most energy-efficient way.
        - Photosynthetic responses are generally similar among the various types of plants
        - morphological response seems to be more species- and cultivar-specific
        - ***Red*** radiation is often considered the most efficient at driving photosynthesis based on the quantum yield.
        - ***Blue*** light, however, is essential for both the vegetative and flowering stages of plant growth. 
        - we have found that ***red, then green, followed by blue light are most effective in photosynthesis***, based on the quantum yield for CO2

1. Competitive Analysis / User Research
    - ***The Definition of Vertical Farming and its history***
        1. Vertical farming is the practice of growing crops in vertically stacked layers. It often incorporates controlled-environment agriculture, which aims to optimize plant growth, and soilless farming techniques such as hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics.
        2. Vertical farming often but not always uses technology to aid the growing process, for example, common elements include:
            - humidity control
            - temperature control
            - artificial lighting (mixes of artificial and natural light can be used)
            - control/monitoring of nutrients and fertilizer
        3. The modern concept "vertical farming" was popularized in the 1990's by Dickson Despommier, a professor of ecology at Columbia University in NYC.
        4. Today in 2020, There are over 100 commercial vertical farming companies that have raised venture capital and are actually growing food that you have likely already purchased at the grocery store!

    - ***Pros and Cons***
        1. Pros:
            - Reduction of food miles

        2. Cons:
            - Extreme cost to operate from a financial perspective: According to IDTechEx, the power and labour costs. 
            - Vertical farming companies face a difficult decision between the extremely high start-up costs of a highly automated facility to reduce labour costs and improve efficiency, versus a cheaper facility with less automation and higher labour costs. 
            - The report states that very few vertical farming companies currently operate profitably. 
            - If investor enthusiasm dies down, companies that are not operating efficiently could suffer.

        3. Extreme cost to operate from a resource perspective (energy): Vertical farming uses a lot of electricity. This not only makes vertical farming expensive but also presents issues with sustainability, with the energy used in the process far outweighing the benefits of reduced transport through local production.

        4. ps: key question: how much energy does a vertical farm need? The required amount of water and CO2 can be reduced compared to a ‘traditional’ greenhouse, but this is not the case for the cooling and dehumidification demand. The high internal heat load and the lack of natural ventilation ensure a high cooling demand, which consequently results in the residual heat

        5. Re-use residual heat: Graamans says the question is whether this residual heat could be used in the surrounding urban environment. “One of the key features of vertical farming is that it can take place in the city, which would allow it to exchange energy with other users. Those other users could become customers of the residual heat from the vertical farm.”

        6. Mostly limited to leafy greens and herbs: high value crops that are easy to grow and where most of the mass of the crop can be eaten.

        7. The PROBLEM is not just about FOOD PRODUCTION, but also about the costs for water, energy and CO2.

     - Pontential keys to the success of the industry
        - Growing methods
        - LEDs and lighting (Improved resource-use efficiency)
        - Environmental controls: Plant condition issues like: CO2, Nutrients, Climate
        - Sensors
        - Automation (Robotics)
        - Container farming
        - Food safety / HACCP
      
    - Vertical farming often but not always uses technology to aid the growing process, for example common elements include:
        - humidity control
        - temperature control
        - artificial lighting (mixes of artificial and natural light can be used)
        - control / monitoring of nutrients and fertilizer
        
    - [Top 3 Reasons Why Vertical Farms Fail](https://www.maximumyield.com/top-3-reasons-why-vertical-farms-fail/2/3177)
        1. They try to do too many things at once. "Farmers can either grow food or develop technology, but they shouldn’t do both"
        2. They forget that labor is always the biggest cost.
        3. They don’t treat the farm like a process.

    - [The 4 Factors of Vertical Farm Success](https://www.maximumyield.com/the-4-factors-of-vertical-farm-success/2/3319)
        - Factor #1: Space-use efficiency and productivity
        - Factor #2: Labor Costs
        - Factor #3: Profitability
        - Factor #4: Environment and Plant Health

    - Current examples of crops and business models
         - High Value: Low Volume - herbs and micro-greens
         - High volume - Close to Customer: leafy greens and salads
         - Plant Breeding: seed crops
         - Medicinal/ Plantceuticals/Biofactories

    - What are the costs involved?

# 'Agtech' in German Startup ecosystem

![img](https://github.com/AiForAgriculture/aiforagriculture.github.io/raw/master/assets/img/farm/20200926_105497.JPG)

- In Germany, corporates are currently more interested in already developed ideas and are reluctant to take risks.
- Startups have no difficulty in obtaining investments and funding, but this support is usually limited to the beginning of the startup. In Germany there is a lack of funding in later phases of the startup.

# FAQs

![img](https://github.com/AiForAgriculture/aiforagriculture.github.io/raw/master/assets/img/farm/20200828_115417.jpg)

1. ***How do we coordinate work?***  
    - We follow [Agile](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/epics-stories-themes) way of working. 
    - we use Jira board to create Epics, Stories and Subtasks. 
    - Upon joining team, each Contributor will get access to our own Jira board.

1. ***How does Contributor contribute?***
- Three simple steps to follow.

Checkout this video with process mention in detail.

[![Checkout this video with process mention in detail!](https://github.com/AiForAgriculture/aiforagriculture.github.io/raw/master/assets/img/other_research/FAQ_video_thumbnil.jpg)](https://youtu.be/RoqhbhU2jC4)


    - One. Cerate a Subtask.
        - Each contributor creates its own subtask for the Story that he/she is working on.

    - Two. Work using your own choice of toolsets.
        - The contributor then continues to research and development on the subtask using a choice of tools that he/she is comfortable with.

    - Three. Submit final work to Git repository.  
        - The contributor then submits his/her research, findings, presentations, etc. to the Git repository.
        - For this we will follow the simplified [Gitflow](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/github-flow#following-the-github-flow), i.e.
            - The contributor creates own branch.
            - Upload work in the branch
            - We will review the branch (or pull request) together.
            - Merge it to the Master branch(the main branch from where work is visible in the project website). 


1. ***What exactly do we expect Contributors to produce?*** 
    - We expect each contributor to produce a comprehensive research work for most of the points mention in the [Discovery phase](https://aiforagriculture.github.io/ai_for_agriculture.html#Discovery_phase)
    - i.e.
        - Competitive Analysis 
        - Define Problem Statement 
        - Interview questioner
        - Document user interview results
        - Craft personas 
        - POC Ideation
    - Each individual may produce his/her own work on these topics which may or may not aligned with other contributors.   

1. ***Where dose Contributors research work get added to the project?***
    - We create a separate space in the "Case Studies" section for each Contributor.
    - We will help Contributors to push their research work, that they have done on any given tool, to Github repository. 
    - An example, [HERE](https://aiforagriculture.github.io/ai_for_agriculture.html#new_case_study) 

1. ***Example of end to end Discovery phase?***
    - Sample vision of Discovery phase, applying Design Thinking Double Diamond Strategy is mention [HERE](https://aiforagriculture.github.io/ai_for_agriculture.html#example_Discovery_Phase)

1. ***How to create my branch from github.com website?***  
    - All details available [HERE](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository)

1. ***How flexible is the problem definition mentioned in case studies***  
    - The ‘problem definition’ mentioned is for reference only and not to be taken for granted.
    - Though one can use it as a starting point to start his research.
